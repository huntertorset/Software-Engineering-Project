Tests

Test Case Number: Z-0-00.

Author: Larisa Fossum, Dylan McShane, Hunter Torset

Name: "Is the data there?"

Purpose: When successful, this test demonstrates that the user can reach the public data repository necessary for the visualization.

Precondition: The computer is turned on and has an active connection to a network. The Google Chrome Browser is installed on the computer.

Steps:
Open the Google Chrome Browser.
From the browser, visit: https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=19DK7erAPFylgG9cCdJZg23CUo3kzIZYiy5Gpkvgf. The browser should display:



Postcondition: The browser displays the Google Fusion Table storing the data used for the product. Affirm that there are six columns of 300 rows of data. The first row is 2013, Q4, Boston, 491, $269, $240.  The above picture is not of the Google Fusion table. We have yet to input the data into it as of creating this test. However, the Fusion table will have the same data represented above.
